# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS: unexpected results due to order of operations. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.

The problem arises because `calc()` calculations might not be performed as intuitively expected in all situations.
